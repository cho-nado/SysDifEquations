# Solving a system of differential equations with n variables and n unknowns using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method

With this code, you can solve a system of differential equations with any number of variables and any number of unknowns using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method.

## What is that? 
The Runge-Kutta method is a numerical technique used to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The 4th-order Runge-Kutta method is a common variant because it provides a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

The "4th order" refers to the error reduction; the error per step is proportional to the step size raised to the 5th power, making it more accurate than lower-order methods.

### Advantages include:

* High accuracy with relatively few steps.
* Good stability for a wide range of problems.
* It does not require higher derivatives of the function, only function evaluations.
